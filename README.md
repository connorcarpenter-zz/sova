# Sova Game Engine

This game engine aims to facilitate quick 2D game development targeting WebAssembly for use on all major web browsers. It can also compile to a Linux app for the intent of easier debugging. This is a work in progress!

The rendering layer relies on floooh's excellent 3d framework Oryol: https://github.com/floooh/oryol
